# Automated-Feature-Engineering-Algorithms
These algorithms aim to automate the process of feature engineering, which is the creation and selection of features (or input variables) that can improve the performance of machine learning models. This process is often time-consuming and requires domain expertise, so automating it could significantly streamline the machine learning process.
